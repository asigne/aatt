Getting Started
--------------------

The easiest way to get started is to simply upload the plugin to the plugins directory. Activate the plugin and then go to the manual options page (make sure you are logged in as the admin otherwise you will not see the options page).  Paste in the serial you received when you subscribed to this plugin and hit the save changes button.

The Developer Guide
----------------------------

If you are a developer and plan to use this for your future clients we recommend editing the config.php file first, and using that as your master copy. This will save you a lot of time in the future:
Open the config.php and paste the serial into the config.php before uploading.
We also recommend making other customization like changing logos, and adding your own videos in the config file as well.
If you want change the menu icon image, then edit line 13 of plugin.php and change the link to point to your own logo.

If you have any questions about the plugin, please refer to our FAQ pages at: http://www.videousermanuals.com/faq/
